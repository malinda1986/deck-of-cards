## Running the tests

 - cd into frontend and run `yarn cypress:open`
 - select the spec or select all to run


### Notes
- Frontend can be optimized further ( separate out services and request call, make ui components more re usable)
- I have done only few test cases, it can be extended with more time
- There is slight delay counting the deck moves, so please keep the small time gap between each click
- Leader board is stored in local storage and its not validate with login (just a fake signup with email)

## Built With
- NodeJs
- React 
- tests - cypress.io
- api doc - swagger

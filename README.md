# Deck App

## Getting Started

Clone the project from ``https://github.com/malinda1986/deck-of-cards.git``


### How to run


### Web app
 - cd in to frontend folder
 - ```run yarn install```
 - ```run yarn start```
 - web app start in ```http://localhost:3000```(make sure 3000 port is free)

 ### Backend 
 - cd in to server folder
 - ```run npm install```
 - ```run npm run dev ```
 - api server start ```http://localhost:8080``` (make sure 8080 port is free)

## How to play
 - run the frontend and goto ```http://localhost:3000```
 - goto login screen and enter details
 - click load cards 
 - select card one by one (keep some interval)
 - you can see the move count
 - once all cards match , it will display the success message
 - click leader board to view the leader board result
 - goto login screen and log with different details and play the game
 - then view the leader board
## Running the tests

 - cd into frontend and run `yarn cypress:open`
 - select the spec or select all to run


### Notes
- Frontend can be optimized further ( separate out services and request call, make ui components more re usable)
- I have done only few test cases, it can be extended with more time
- There is slight delay counting the deck moves, so please keep the small time gap between each click
- Leader board is stored in local storage and its not validate with login (just a fake signup with email)

## Built With
- NodeJs
- React 
- tests - cypress.io
